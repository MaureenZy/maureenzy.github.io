Hi! I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the math department at University of California, Irvine. 
<br>
My thesis advisor is <a href="https://www.math.uci.edu/~mreyes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manny Reyes</a>.
<br>
I am interested in the intersection of Ring Theory and Category Theory.
<br>
My research explores the structural elegance of non-commutative rings and twisted tensor products.
<br>
Additionally, I enjoy strategy games, ballet and swimming. I believe in community building and am committed to helping others :)
